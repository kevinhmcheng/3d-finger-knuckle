# 3d-finger-knuckle
This folder provides sample data and codes for the feature extration and matching. Please run 'main.m' to start the program.

## Data:
- Two subjects, each with two surface normal images, resulted in four surface normal images

## Feature Extraction:
- Reads from the surface normal images and produces the feature images (2 binary images for each surface normal image)

## Matching:
- Reads from the feature images and produces the similarity score for each pair of feature images
